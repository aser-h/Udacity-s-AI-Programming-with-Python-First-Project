# Udacity's AI Programming with Python First Project
 Project: Using a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

## Project Objective:
The initial project centered around utilizing a provided image classifier to recognize various dog breeds. The emphasis was not on training or constructing the classifier itself, but rather on showcasing proficient Python abilities for establishing a machine learning project. This encompassed tasks such as managing the data, evaluating diverse metrics, examining outcomes, and comparing the execution times of distinct classifiers.

This project aimed to accomplish the following goals:

1. Distinguishing between images of pets that depict dogs and those that do not.
2. Categorizing the specific breeds of dogs for the images recognized as dogs.
3. Assessing the effectiveness of different CNN model architectures (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG16) in achieving objectives 1 and 2.
## Conclusion 
The project successfully fulfilled the criteria specified in the 'Results Table,' revealing the following findings:

The VGG model emerged as the superior CNN architecture, achieving a flawless 100% accuracy in discerning between "dogs" and "non-dogs," and displaying the highest level of performance in accurately classifying dog breeds, also achieving 100% accuracy.
